## 👨‍💻 Engineering Philosophy

I design and build production-grade data systems with a platform-first mindset.

My work focuses on distributed architecture, streaming infrastructure, and scalable cloud data platforms engineered for reliability, observability, and long-term maintainability.

With experience spanning infrastructure environments, safety-critical operations, analytics, and AI systems, I approach data engineering as systems engineering, emphasizing fault tolerance, modularity, and performance from day one.
